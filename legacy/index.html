    <h2>About Me!</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is Azaan and I enjoy creating things that use electricity and programmable logic. (Maybe that's how I ended up in Engineering)
        My interest in technology and electronics started when I enrolled in project courses at university involving microcontrollers (Such as the EFM8 and the PIC32)
        and created technologies which could ease accessibility. Studying Electrical Engineering at the University of British Columbia
        led me to discover my thirst for learning more about computer systems and electrical engineering theory. From learning how transistors compute 
        to making my own RISC machine on the DE1-SOC, I have become even more passionate about technology. 

        With a deep interest in computer systems and control systems engineering, I hope to work with robotics, automation and development of computer softwares and applications.
        To enhance my skills outside university and discover more interests, I have built <a href="/projects">projects.</a>

    </p>
    <h2 id = "lower_section">Interests</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Robotics</li>
    <li>Embedded Systems</li>
    <li>Programming and development of software such as web apps (Using C and Javascript!)</li>
    <li>I love gaming (Always willing to chat about Apex Legends!</li>
    <li>Playing Badminton and going for Jogs!</li>
    </ul>
