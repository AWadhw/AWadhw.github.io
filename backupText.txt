Hi! My name is Azaan and I enjoy creating things that use electricity and programmable logic. (Maybe
                    that's how I ended up in Engineering)
                    My interest in technology and electronics started when I enrolled in project courses at university
                    involving microcontrollers (Such as the EFM8 and the PIC32)
                    and created technologies which could ease accessibility. Studying Electrical Engineering at the
                    University of British Columbia
                    led me to discover my thirst for learning more about computer systems and electrical engineering
                    theory. From learning how transistors compute
                    to making my own RISC machine on the DE1-SOC, I have become even more passionate about technology.
